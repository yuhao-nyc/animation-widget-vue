Todos:
1. fixing the timing animation of different parts in the component. Like the heading above the images on screen 2
2. update the animation of the heading. should be a top -> bottom elastic slide
3. move 2 screens into its own components
4. use a different animation strategy. instead of having the images exist on 2 screens. using css + js to give elastic animation of the images on screen 1
